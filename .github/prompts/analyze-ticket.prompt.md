# Analyze Jira Ticket

Analyze Jira ticket **{ticket-id}** and provide a comprehensive assessment without making any code changes.

## Prerequisites
- Atlassian MCP connection is required
- Reference: `.github/prompts/_partials/jira-integration.md`

## Steps

### 1. Verify Jira Access
- Use `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` to confirm connectivity
- Get the correct cloud ID for subsequent calls

### 2. Fetch Ticket Details
- Use `getJiraIssue` with ticket **{ticket-id}**
- Request fields: `summary`, `description`, `status`, `issuetype`, `priority`, `assignee`
- Read all comments for additional context

### 3. Analyze Codebase Impact
- Search the codebase for related components
- Identify files likely to be modified
- Check for existing implementations or patterns

### 4. Generate Report

Provide the following structured analysis:

#### 📋 Summary
Brief overview of what needs to be done.

#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1

#### 🔍 Technical Impact
| Area | Files/Components | Impact Level |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| Components | list | High/Medium/Low |
| Actions | list | High/Medium/Low |
| Types | list | High/Medium/Low |

#### 📊 Complexity Estimate
- **Level**: Simple / Medium / Complex
